Do you wanna go out with me, to skate on ice?
Sipping some hot chocolate with some flurries and fries.

Am I being stupid to do this again?
Or is it just the butterflies all over my brain,
Feeling my heartbeat, It’s ready for the highs!
For an experience sweet and sexy and full of spice.

Dropped a few hints, to avoid a surprise,
As I can’t look away, from your sparkling eyes.
From child education to empowerment and equality,
Your thoughts are so inspiring, to improve life’s quality.

There might be a que, for you and me and everybody new!
And we can always talk and smile and understand a few,
But why settle for good when we can have the best,
Rolling and laughing through this spirited quest

Life goes fast and its full of turns and ways,
So, are you ready to enjoy this exciting maze? 
And in this journey, we might fall and stumble,
But I am sure, we will be up stronger, happier and a bit more humble

So, do you wanna go out with me, to skate on ice?
Sipping some hot chocolate with some flurries and fries.
