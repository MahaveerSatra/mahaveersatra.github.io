<p align="center">
Do you wanna go out with me, to skate on ice?<br>
Sipping hot chocolate with some flurries and fries.<br>
</p>

<p align="center">
Am I being stupid to do this again?<br>
Or is it just the butterflies all over my brain,<br>
Feeling my heartbeat, it’s ready for the highs!<br>
For an experience sweet and sexy and full of spice.<br>
</p>

<p align="center">
Dropped a few hints, to avoid a surprise,<br>
As I can’t look away, from your sparkling eyes.<br>
From child education to empowerment and equality,<br>
Your thoughts are so inspiring, to improve life’s quality.<br>
</p>

<p align="center">
There might be a que, for you and me and everybody new!<br>
And we can always talk and smile and understand a few,<br>
But why settle for good when we can have the best,<br>
Rolling and laughing through this spirited quest.<br>
</p>

<p align="center">
Life goes fast and its full of turns and ways,<br>
So, are you ready to enjoy this exciting maze? <br>
And in this journey, we might fall and stumble,<br>
But I am sure, we will be up stronger, happier and a bit more humble<br>
</p>

So, do you wanna go out with me, to skate on ice?<br>
